## How to Play

Control your freekick direction with your left-right keydowns.

You can shoot Driven Shot(Q+D) or Bananenflanke(Z+D) and the shot type is determined by your keystroke.

For your freekick practice the freekick spot is random so there are no parameters that you should set.   

Your only mission is to press the right key and fit your intended gage for your freekick.

All settings are the same as those in FIFA Online 4.
