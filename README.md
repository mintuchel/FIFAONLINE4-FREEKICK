## Build

To run this code, you need the vpython module. You have two options:

I recommend you to run this code on Web VPython since Web VPython has a standardized key-input format
  
1. Use Web VPython directly.
   - Visit [glowscript.org](https://www.glowscript.org).
   - Sign in and click Create a new file.
   - Copy the code and run it.

2. Download the vpython module and run the code on vscode.
   - Install the vpython module in the vscode terminal using the command: `pip install vpython`.
   - Create a .py file for this game and import the vpython module using `from vpython import *`.

Note: The $PATH or tasks.json file does not need to be modified because the code is run by an online compiler, not your local compiler.  

## How to Play

Control the direction of your freekick using the left and right arrow keys.

You can perform a Driven Shot (Q+D) or a Bananenflanke (Z+D) by pressing the corresponding key combination.

The shot type is determined by your keystrokes.

During your freekick practice, the freekick spot is randomized, so there are no specific parameters that you need to set.

Your goal is to press the right key and match your intended power gauge for the freekick.

All settings in the game are the same as those in FIFA Online 4.
